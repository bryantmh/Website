<h2 style="padding-left: 30px;">About Me</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;">
	My name is Bryant Hinton, and I am currently a Junior in BYU's Computer Science program. During which time I have learned the basics of good programming, and built many programs in languages such as C++ and Java.<br><br>

	For the past several years, I have been working at Brigham Young University's department of Risk Management doing computer support, and more recently, web programming. So, I am familiar with many of the technologies in use today, and adept at using them to build and maintain web pages. For example, I used a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and jQuery to build several forms and webpages at risk.byu.edu, as well as updated older code at the same site. I also have experience with bash and terminal, am familiar with how to install and run apache and nginx servers, and have experience pulling from and interacting with SQL databases.

	I am a hard worker, and am always striving to improve my skills and to do some good in the world. I am a quick learner, and also love to learn new things. I work well with others, and I believe I have the skills and work ethic to make a difference for good.<hr>
